## Give us a hand and get in free!

Volunteers make festivals run — and volunteering at the inaugural Sleepy Hollow Music Festival is a fun way for high school kids to finish up those last few community service hours, and for grownups to have a great time and meet new people while giving back to the community. Did we mention you’ll get in free (and get a cool t shirt)?

Volunteers will be needed both for pre-festival and day-of-show.

We need help with:
-Guest Hospitality
-Box Office
-Vendor Coordination
-Site Management
-Parking

If you’re interested in volunteering, please fill in the form here.
