### GETTING HERE:

If you’re mapping it, Kingsland Point Park is located at 299 Palmer Ave in Sleepy Hollow, NY. It is accessible via Metro-North Train (Tarrytown or Philipse Manor stations are walking distance), or by car, bike or boat (really).

### PARKING:

There is no onsite parking and parking near the festival is limited. We suggest you use public transportation like the Metro-North train or bike to the fest (bike parking will be available). If you need to drive in, try to carpool with a buddy. Precise parking instructions will be released shortly.

### WHERE TO STAY:

There are several great hotels in the area, in various price ranges. Our Official Hotel Partner is&nbsp;Tarrytown House Estate. Call and mention you’re with the festival and you’ll get a good deal. There is no onsite camping for Year One of the festival.
