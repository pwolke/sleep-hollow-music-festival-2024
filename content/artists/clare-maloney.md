## Clare Maloney & The Great Adventure

Clare Maloney & The Great Adventure are bringing the era of windows-down, roadtrip rock & roll straight into the playlist generation. Relix magazine named the band an "Artist You Need to Know" in 2023, calling their debut LP 'Daybreaker' “stunning” and praising its “brilliant vocals, rocking band and polished songwriting.” The album title stands as a sly ode to bandleader Clare Maloney's decade-long battle with writer's block, and triumph over it; night gives way to day, just as the multi-instrumentalist and former opera singer broke through to write over 100 songs in 2021, flawlessly blending rock, alt-country, americana, folk, funk, the great american songbook & more.

Clare’s powerful and emotive vocal stylings are rooted in her early career as a classical singer, performing at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and throughout Europe and Asia. Despite success in the opera world, Clare felt the magnetism of the rock & roll music she grew up on, and daringly transitioned from the classical stage to become a first-call session and touring vocalist, sharing the stage with members of The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Starship, Allman Brothers Band, Hall & Oates and the E Street Band along the way. As a writer, Clare's unique and unmistakable voice is shaped by classical literature and poetry, and the sounds of her native New York – from Tin Pin Alley to CBGB's to Broadway and Brooklyn.

The band supported their December ‘22 release “Daybreaker” with a 50-date national tour in 2023. Highlights from their breakout year include openings slots for Pat Benatar & Neil Giraldo, The Wailers and Bailen, pre-shows for Robert Plant & Alison Krauss, Phil Lesh & Friends, and Aimee Mann, and sit ins from members of Goose. The band features Nate DeBrine, who co-produced Daybreaker, on guitar and vocals, Russ Gottlieb on bass and electric banjo, and Caleb Estey on drums and vocals."""
