## Anthony Giaccio & The Assortments

Anthony Giaccio has been writing songs most of his adult life, but only recently started recording and performing them. &nbsp;He has recorded two albums, Out Run the Rain and recently released Down This Highway. Both albums feature his band The Assortments. &nbsp;His songs can be described as being a little bit of country and a little bit of Rock and Roll. &nbsp;This mix creates a unique but familiar sound that has been well received by listeners. &nbsp;Giaccio and The Assortments perform at various venues in Westchester and New York City."""
