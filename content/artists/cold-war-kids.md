## Cold War Kids

Now in its 20th year, this California-based band draws from its blues-and-soul-driven sonic past along with fresh forays into dance beats and pop/rock. "First," their platinum-selling 2015 single, has been named as the most played track at alternative radio outlets nationwide in the last decade. “Run Away With Me,” from their current album, with its funky grooves and huge chorus, sets the tone for the album’s 12 stylistically diverse songs referencing everything from Sly and the Family Stone and Curtis Mayfield, to the Pretenders and Elton John, to Happy Mondays and Gang of Four."""
