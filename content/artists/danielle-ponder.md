## Danielle Ponder

In 2021, Danielle Ponder appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival where her set was hailed as one of the eventâ€™s stand-out performances. 2022 was a banner year for Danielle with appearances on Late Night with Seth Meyers, CBS This Morning, tours with Marcus Mumford, Amos Lee, St. Paul and the Broken Bones, and Leon Bridges. In September of 2022, Danielle released her debut album Some of Us Are Brave on Future Classic. The album is a refreshingly original, shiver-inducing mix of pop, R&B, blues, rock, and moody trip-hop topped by Ponder's celestial voice."""
