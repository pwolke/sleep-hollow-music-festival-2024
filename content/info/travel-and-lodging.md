## Travel & Lodging Tidbits

The event features two stages, lots of food and drink options, and plenty to keep kids of all ages entertained. Join us at the beautiful Kingsland Point Park in legendary Sleepy Hollow, NY as we usher in summer along the Hudson River.

### GETTING HERE:

If you’re mapping it, Kingsland Point Park is located at 299 Palmer Ave in Sleepy Hollow, NY. It is accessible via Metro-North Train (Tarrytown or Philipse Manor stations are walking distance), or by car, bike or boat (really).

### PARKING:

There is no onsite parking and parking near the festival is limited. We suggest you use public transportation like the Metro-North train or bike to the fest (bike parking will be available). If you need to drive in, try to carpool with a buddy. Precise parking instructions will be released shortly.

### WHERE TO STAY:

There are several great hotels in the area, in various price ranges. Our Official Hotel Partner is&nbsp;Tarrytown House Estate. Call and mention you’re with the festival and you’ll get a good deal. There is no onsite camping for Year One of the festival.
