      <description>Give us a hand and get in free! Volunteers make festivals run — and volunteering at the inaugural Sleepy Hollow Music Festival is a fun way for high school kids to finish up those last few community service hours, and for grownups to have a great time and meet new people while giving back to the community. Did we mention you’ll get in free (and get a cool t shirt)?</description>
